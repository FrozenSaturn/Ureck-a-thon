        <h3>About Us</h3>

        <p>
          Welcome to ReportIt, a dedicated platform for corporate women to share
          their workplace experiences and contribute to building safer work
          environments. At [Website Name], we believe in transparency,
          accountability, and empowerment.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

        <p>
          Our mission is to provide a safe and confidential space for corporate
          women to share their experiences of workplace harassment,
          discrimination, or any form of misconduct. By collecting and
          documenting these incidents with verified identities, we aim to create
          a comprehensive database that can be accessed by women seeking
          information about the safety record of potential employers.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>

        <p>
          To contribute to our database, users must submit their experiences
          with valid identification and details of their company and branch.
          Each submission is carefully reviewed, and appropriate action is taken
          to address reported issues. We are committed to maintaining the
          privacy and confidentiality of all users while promoting transparency
          and accountability in corporate environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Join Us</h3>
